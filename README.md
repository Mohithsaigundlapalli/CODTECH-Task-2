Description:
Task 2 :
Map Out a Target User Flow:
Before starting wireframing, understand how users will interact with your app. Create a user flow—a series of steps users take to achieve specific goals. User flows help you determine the number of screens you’ll need and how they should connect. Visualize this using basic objects like boxes and arrows.
Sketch the Core User Flow:
Visualize the user flow by sketching it out. Explore various design directions. Use paper or digital sketching tools to let your creativity shine. Share these quick concepts with others, gather feedback, and iterate.
Set a Mobile Frame:
Start wireframing by defining the mobile frame. Consider the screen size and aspect ratio of the target device. This ensures your wireframes align with the actual screen dimensions.
Determine Layout Using Boxes:
Create wireframe boxes to represent different elements on each screen. These boxes outline where content, buttons, images, and text will go. Focus on layout and structure.
Use Design Patterns:
Leverage common design patterns for consistency. For example, navigation bars, buttons, and form fields should follow established conventions.
Bring in Actual Copy:
Replace placeholder text with actual content. Use real labels, headings, and descriptions. This helps you visualize how the app will look and feel.
Ensure Content Scales Well:
Consider different screen sizes and orientations. Ensure your wireframes adapt gracefully to various devices.
Connect Pages to Create a Flow:
Link wireframes together to demonstrate user navigation. Show how screens transition from one to another.
Test Your Design Decisions:
Validate your wireframes by sharing them with stakeholders, users, or colleagues. Gather feedback and iterate as needed.
Remember, wireframes are the foundation upon which your app’s design and functionality will be built. They help you visualize the user experience and ensure a smooth development process
